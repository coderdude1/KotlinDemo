# Kotlin Basics Demo
This is a demo of very basic kotin stuff

# Kotlin Overview
Kotlin is a language created by Jetbrains (intellij geeks).  A few years ago as it really grew in popularity, a new group
called the Kotlin Foundation was created to manage the language.  A bit after Google announced that kotlin was officially
a supported first class language for Android development.  Spring announced around the same time that they added explicit
support for kotlin in spring boot 2 and spring 5 for functional programming (and included amongst other things a new
Kotlin DSL for it's endpoints).  Kotlin is released under the Apache 2 license

# Discussion Points
## Some key points on kotlin vs java
### Seamless Integration with java
This was a design goal from the start.  This makes it very easy to start mixing kotlin and java, simply add the dependency to 
gradle/maven.  A very common starting point for adding Kotlin to a project is replacing DTOs and Pojos, making them actually 
readable (getter/setter/toString/equals/hashcode/copy are autogenerated, I will show this in a bit)
