# Kotlin Basics Demo
This is a demo of very basic kotin stuff

# Kotlin Overview
Kotlin is a language created by Jetbrains (intellij geeks).  A few years ago as it really grew in popularity, a new group
called the Kotlin Foundation was created to manage the language.  A bit after Google announced that kotlin was officially
a supported first class language for Android development.  Spring announced around the same time that they added explicit
support for kotlin in spring boot 2 and spring 5 for functional programming (and included amongst other things a new
Kotlin DSL for it's endpoints).  Kotlin is released under the Apache 2 license

# Discussion Points
## Some key points on kotlin vs java
### Seamless Integration with java
This was a design goal from the start.  This makes it very easy to start mixing kotlin and java, simply add the dependency to 
gradle/maven.  A very common starting point for adding Kotlin to a project is replacing DTOs and Pojos, making them actually 
readable (getter/setter/toString/equals/hashcode/copy are autogenerated, I will show this in a bit)

## Dev Tools
Intellij has native support for Kotlin.  Eclipse has a plugin that I've read is pretty good but have not tried it.  I've read that 
Visual Studio has good support,  I assume it wraps around the CLI stuff. 

## Native kotlin libs and frameworks
* [Ktor - Async webserver]( https://ktor.io/) and [another guide](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2885892-server-side-kotlin-with-ktor)
* [Spek - testing framework](https://github.com/spekframework/spek) supports specification style (Jasmine/RSpec) and 
gherkin (cucumber) [data driven test](https://github.com/spekframework/spek/issues/521).  [Baeldog article on spek](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-spek)

## Functional patterns and such
* [Arrow functional companion to the kotlin stardard lib](https://arrow-kt.io/) has several topics including patterns, typeclasses, etc

##Some usage stats
* [Jetbrains tracking usages](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/kotlin/).  Note non-android dev is quite high.
Breakdown on popular tools, and frameworks for kotlin.  Includes a chart showing a breakdown of what platform kotlin is used to develop software for.  I took
this as the intended runtime.  Android obviously was the 1st one but linux is very high
